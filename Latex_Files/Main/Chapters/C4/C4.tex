\chapter{Conclusion}

In conclusion, we can quite evidently see a big efficiency improvement to the Costabile method by taking an alternative approach to filling the \(\smax{i}{j}{k}\) vector. However, from our comparison of the results we found through our implementation to that off the original paper by Costabile et al.~there does appear to be some unexpected results which at present time cannot be explained. Due to the nature of the Costabile method, it would be quite simple to modify the pay-off function to account for American style Asian options, an area I would like to look into in future research. Furthermore, it stands to reason that with adjustments to the representative average formula proposed by Costabile; it should be possible to adjust the method to be able to price geometric priced options. This would permit the ability to compare the results to that off the analytical solution.
