    In this report we take a deep look into the fundamental theory surrounding pricing options. Starting from market definitions and assumptions we explore the statistical properties that underpin several asset pricing models and extend it to option valuation with constant reference to the relevant literature. Finally, we implement a well-established pricing model for Asian options with the use of \textsc{Matlab} and attempt to make it more efficient by reducing the time complexity of the algorithm.
